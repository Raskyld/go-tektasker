# Contribution

This project is in its early day and is mostly an effort to
participate in the [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com) 2023!

It's also my first open-source project as a maintainer.
I am just going to say that if you are interested in the concept or idea
of the project, and wish to work with me on it, you can just get
in touch with me on the Tekton Slack, so we can start structuring the project
a bit more.
