# Contribution

This project is in its early day and is mostly an effort to
participate in the [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com) 2023!

It's also my first open-source project as a maintainer.
I am just gonna say that if you are interested in the concept or idea
of the project, and wish to work with me on it, you can just drop me
a mail at `enzo@nocera.eu` so we can get in touch and I can start
structuring the work a bit more ;)
