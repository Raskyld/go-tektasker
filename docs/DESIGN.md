# Design

Tektasker makes few things and does them well:
* Read Go Code
* Generate YAML Manifest
* Generate helper Go Code

Everything else is handled by separate and specific programs:
* **Building and publication** of image is made by [`ko`](https://github.com/ko-build/ko)
* **Specialisation** of manifest generated by `tektasker` for users to be able to enforce
  their own Kubernetes policies is handled by `kustomize`. `tektakser` generates
  the base, users write their specific overlays
* **Validation** of the generated manifests is handled by [`kubeconform`](https://github.com/yannh/kubeconform)

Finally, to provide a good developer experience, all these moving parts are integrated
together using a [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev).

This is an opinionated setup but users may integrate `tektasker` in their own build system (e.g. *Bazel*)
